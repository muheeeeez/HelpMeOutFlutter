# Production Readiness - HelpMeOut Flutter App

This document summarizes all the optimizations and improvements made to prepare the HelpMeOut Flutter app for production deployment.

## 1. Dependency Updates

- Updated all dependencies to use the latest stable versions (projected for 2025)
- Removed unused dependencies:
  - Removed `flutter_native_splash` as it was not being used
  - Removed `screen_recorder` as it was not properly implemented
  - Removed `fluttertoast` and replaced with built-in `ScaffoldMessenger`
  - Removed `ffmpeg_kit_flutter_new` as it was imported but never used in the codebase
  - Removed `file_picker` as it was not used anywhere in the code
